# Simple React App
Made by watching along with Austin Davis React crash course on Youtube:
- [Austin Davis](https://www.youtube.com/@AustinDavisTech/videos)

Played around with changing things up, condensing and improving code different from what was done in the video to make it my own work

This is a simple and basic, barebones React app that touches upon key functionality such as
- Basic component structure
- Prop Usage and Destructuring
- State (useState)
- Event Handling and useEffect
- Lists and some OOP with React
- Conditional Rendering
- Multi-page Rendering and Navigation

Converted project to Typescript - JSX version can be found here: https://github.com/aschoolnick/react-app
